# SQL Optimization
 Optimizing SQL Queries

A SQL table with preset queries is provided. This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing each query by evaluating the queries using EXPLAIN clause, SQL Profiler, and other performance tuning techniques to significantly reduce query cost and runtime.

### Structure
Each query is separated into q-folders with its respective documentation of initial query versus the optimized query.
